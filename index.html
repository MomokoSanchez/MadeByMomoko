                  I believe in simplicity. No spaghetti code, but clean and robust scripting. I am always looking for clear-cut and performant solutions rather than dirty hacks and aim to comply with given coding standards.

                  I strive to make websites that are user friendly and easy to navigate. I would rather go for minimalism than for obtrusive clutter. To improve an interface, I can conduct A/B testing with external tools or via prototyping with qualiative and quantitative interviews.

              Are you a small Tech Company or Web Developer Agency? I would love to work in an environment that encourages growth, because I am always eager to learn. The perfect place would be a small team that is happy to share knowledge, feels comfortable with lots of coffee, prefers humbleness and honesty over inflated egos and is just the right amount of nerdy. <br/>It would be important for me, that you have a good ranking on the Joel Test – its wording might be outdated, but in my opinion it addresses fields that are a vital foundation for any good Development Team. <br/>The best place to work is in the Edmonton Area, but I am also available for remote work.

            <p>
              All my projects are made with Sass, build with Gulp, <a href="https://github.com/MomokoSanchez/">version controlled</a> with Git and  based on the Twitter Bootstrap Framework. For building prototypes and mockups, I use Axure and Photoshop<sup>&reg;</sup>.<br/>
              I am most proficient with WordPress but I’ve also been working with Drupal, Joomla and ModX to a good extend. I hold a M.Sc. in IT and Media from LMU in Germany. That means that I have a fundamentally sound background, allowing me to quickly adapt to new languages and IT systems.<br/>
              I am always learning, ready for a challenge and excited to improve. My next goal is to build up expertise in Search Engine Optimization. I am also constantly working on improving my design skills.

            <h1>BRAGI</h1>
            <p>
              Bragi is a leading innovater in Hearable Computing and brought the first wireless smart earphone to the market, long before Apple decided to ditch the headphone jack.<br/>
              As fast moving company, they required up-to-date presentation of ther products. To mirror their approach, their marketing pages also needed to be modern and innovative.<br/>
              The goal was to implement pages for the new products based on the designer's template, as well as to migrate existing pages from multiple platforms to WordPress. 
            </p>
            <h3>MADE WITH</h3>
            <p> 
              The challenge was to build Marketing Pages that would run smoothly with custom animations and background videos. As multiple developers were collaborating on the project, a workflow was developed, that allowed for synchronized merging on local, testing, and live environments. Some of the existing websites had been build with different systems and partially lacked a backend. To ensure optimal manageability, they were be migrated to one CMS.

            </p>
            <h3>RESULTS</h3>
            <p>
              The pages are built with the Bootstrap Framework and most of the animations are implemented with ScrollMagic. The local develoment environment was set up with Vagrant and synchronized with Github. To improve the performance, the content is delivered by a CDN from Amazon Web Services and Google Analytics was implemented to measure user interaction on the Marketing Pages as well as on the shop.<br/>
              The migration of the sites to Wordpress required the CMS to have a customized template, compatibility with a CDN and the ability to add language options, which was achieved by multiple plugins and custom solutions.

            <h3>MADE WITH</h3>
            <p>
              Since the page has mainly representative purpose, it needed to be simple, clear and concise. The design was based on the one page template <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/">Agency</a>. The content is not expected to change often and the web-space has limited capacity and functionality, so the page is pure Front-End without CMS.

            <p>
              The template is based on Bootstrap 3 and the scrolling animations are implemented with scrollmagic. The page was built to load fast  and to be presentable on Google and Facebook links.<br/>
              The only remnants are the logo and the color-scheme and the new design is built around light effects, which also are the company’s central occupation.

            <h1>ASKARI ZEREN</h1>
            <p>
              AskariZeren is a German real estate boutique that needed a new page to present their products which are not only real estates for sale, but also consulting for vendors and buyers. 
            </p>
            <h3>MADE WITH</h3>
            <p>
              The goal was to present the different areas of expertise in a clear and concise way, while conveying a reputable look and feel. The backend needed to be manageable, especially for adding and removing real estate objects. 
            </p>

            </div>
            </p>
            <h3>RESULTS</h3>
            <p>
              The page was built with Boostrap 3, based on the <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/">Agency</a> template. To highlight the detailed content of the different areas, small subpages were created that don't require the page to reload completeley. <br/>
              The template was implemented with WordPress with help from the ACF-Plugin. Multiple options for representing and managing the real estates were considered and an iFrame has been prepared and will soon be implemented to replace the current static content.

            <p>
              The page uses the new Boostrap 4 template. It is built in a minimalistic fashion and works on every modern device and was also created in exactly 51.5 hours (thanks, toggl). The hero animation was made to be the eye catcher of the page and the idea for it came to me in a dream. I have Google Analyticy implemented to find out who actually reads my content and left my Email address for any feedback and in the best case a beautiful job offer.
