            <h1>THIS IS ME</h1>
            <p>
              I am a Front-End Web Developer and you can hire me! Right now I am looking for a fulltime position and in the meantime I create Websites for single persons and small companies. My focus lies on implementing modern responsive Websites with or without a CMS like Wordpress, Drupal, etc. or maintaing and improving existing Websites. <br/>
              I am not a Designer, though. This means I have no degree in Design and am not adept to design a Website from scratch. But I can adapt publicly available templates and implement designs templates from a customer. I also can rate and improve a design regarding UX-Aspects[link].

                <h3>Clean Code</h3>
                <p>
                  I believe in simplicity. No spaghetti code and no overly special complex scripts that might break your design at this one certain resolution. Instead of reinventing the wheel, I try to find solutions, that have been well-tried to combine them to the optimal performance.

                <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
                <p>
                  My websites are made to work with any browser. No matter the screen resolution or the device, ranging from Desktop Computer, Tablet or Mobile Phone, the look and feel of the Website is always adjsted to the device. By the way: having a responsive site with fast loading speed also improves your rating on Google!

                <h3>User Experience</h3>
                <p>
                  I strive to make websites that are user friendly and easy to navigate. I would rather go for minimalism than for obtrusive clutter. To further improve the content, A/B testing can be implemented with external tools or conducted with prototypes through qualiative and quantitative interviews.

                <h3>Tracking</h3>
                <p>
                  Do you want to know how many people visited your website and how they interacted with the content? I can implement Google Analytics and adjust its Dashboard to your needs. I can also give technical support in implementing AdWords, Facebook Pixels and implement the tools with Google Tag Manager.

            <p>
              All my projects are made with Sass and have Version Control with Git. They all are also based on the Twitter Boostrap Framework which just released its new Version 4 beta. <br/>
              For prototyping I use Axure with a little help from Photoshop. <br/>
              My favorite CMS so far is Wordpress, but I've been working with Drupal, ModX and Joomla and I would enjoy to learn mor about them.<br/>
              For tracking  and optimization purposes I use Google Analytics and have also been setting up Google AdWords, Facebook Pixels and staying up to date with Google Search Console while  using Google Tag Manager. <br/>
              I also bring with me a proper master's degree in IT & Media from a German University which gives me the fundaments to learn and adapt to new scripting and progamming languages as well as any other IT systems.

            <h1>BRAGI</h1>
            <p>
              Bragi is a leading innovater in hearable computing and brought the first wireless smart earphone to the market, long before Apple decided to ditch the headphone jack. <br/>
              Being a fast moving company, they constantly need presentation of their products - The Dash, The Headphone and now The Dash Pro. To mirror their innovative approach, their marketing pages also needed to be modern and innovative. <br/>
              The goal was to implement pages for the new products and OS based on the designer's template as well as to migrate existing pages from multiple platforms to Wordpress. 
            </p>
            <h3>MADE WITH</h3>
            <p> 
              The challenge was to build marketing pages that would run smooth with custom animations and background videos. Since there were multiple developers over time, it was necessary to create a workflow that would merge the developers contributions on local environments that needed to be synchronized with testing and live environments. Parts of the existing websites were created on different systems and partly without backend, so they needed to be unified to one CMS to ensure optimal management.

            <h3>RESULTS</h3>
            <p>
              The pages are built on a boostrap template and most of the animations are implemented with scrollmagic. The develoment environment was set up with Vagrant and synchronized with Github. To improve the performance, the content is delivered by a CDN from Amazon Web Services and Google Analytics was implemented to measure user interaction on the Marketing Pages as well as on the shop. <br/>
              The migration of the sites to Wordpress required the CMS to have a customized template, work with a CDN and being able add language options which was achieved by multiple plugins and custom solutions.

            <p>
              Vertemo is a event technology website that serves mostly as a business card. The original page was outdated, so a complete redesign was necessary. 
            </p>
            <h3>MADE WITH</h3>
            <p>
              Since the page has mainly representative purpose, it needed to be simple and clear, so the design was based on the one page template Ageny[link]. There weren't many content changes expected to be and the web space was limited, for this reason the page is pure frontend without a CMS.

            <p>
              The template is based on Boostrap 3 and the scrolling animations are implemented with scrollmagic. The page was built to load fast (score of x on pagespeed) and to be presentable on Google and Facebook links.<br/>
              The only thing that stayed the same, compared to the previous version, was the logo. The new design kept the colors and was built around the idea of light design, which is the central occupation of the person presented.

            <h1>ASKARI ZEREN</h1>
            <p>
              AskariZeren is a german-based real estate boutique that needed a new page to present their products which are not only real estates to sell, but also consulting for vendors and buyers. 
            </p>
            <h3>MADE WITH</h3>
            <p>
              The goal was to present the different areas of expertise in a clear and concise way while conveying a reputable look and feel. The backend needed to be manageable, especially for adding and removing real estate objects. 
            </p>

              </div>
            </div>
            </p>
            <h3>RESULTS</h3>
            <p>
              The page was built with Boostrap 3, based on the Agency template. To highlight the detailed content of the different areas, small subpages were created that don't require the page to reload completeley. <br/>
              The template was implemented with wordpress with help from the ACF-Plugin. Multiple options for representing and managing the real estates were considered and an iFrame has been prepared and will soon be implemented to replace the current static content.

            <h1>MADE BY MOMOKO</h1>
            <p>
              This page simply has the purpose to convince you, that I am the perfect match for your job opening. Thus it needed to be nice and friendly and have some eye-catching animations right from the beginning. 
            </p>
            <h3>MADE WITH</h3>
            <p>
              The page needed to be created in a short time period whith the ideal outcome to be fancy and responsive at the same time
            </p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-12 imgBox">

                <img src="img/Icons/sass.png" class="unCover">

              </div>
            </div>
            </p>
            <h3>RESULTS</h3>
            <p>
              The page was kept as simple as possible and uses the new Boostrap 4 template. It has a more static than fluid approach to responsive design while still working on every modern device and was also created in exactly 51.5 hours (thanks, toggl). The hero animation was made to be the eye catcher of the page and the idea for it came to me in a dream. I have Google Analyticy implemented to find out who actually reads my content and left my Email address for any feedback and in the best case a beautiful job offer.
